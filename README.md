# Maximize to Workspace GNOME Extension

This GNOME Shell extension automatically manages workspaces by assigning **one maximized window per workspace**. It replicates the macOS-style full-screen app behavior, enhancing multitasking and workspace hygiene on GNOME.

## 🧠 Features

- 🪟 When you **maximize a window**, it is automatically moved to a new empty workspace.
- 🧼 Only **one maximized window per workspace** is allowed.
- 🔁 If you unmaximize or close a window, its workspace is automatically:
  - Deleted (if empty and not workspace 0)
  - Focus returns to the previous workspace
- 🧠 Startup-safe: avoids GNOME animation glitches and window stack errors
- 🚫 No settings required – works out of the box
